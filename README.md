4. When a customer purchase any item, it is checked whether the item matches the product Id or not
5. If the quantity of a product that the customer wants to purchase exceeds the originally available quantity, approprite message is displayed and the purchase can't be made
6. Total Bill amount is generated based on the purchases made
7. Each transaction made by the customer is updated accordingly to the 'sales.json' file
